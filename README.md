A fictional website for a **custom bicycle shop**, developed during the **HTML and CSS for Beginners** course by [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/).  
This project combines **UI Design**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a visually appealing and fully responsive website.

- 💬 Contact and quote forms for user interaction  
- ⚙️ JavaScript interactivity and dynamic elements  
- 🎨 A visually consistent design inspired by real-world product sites
